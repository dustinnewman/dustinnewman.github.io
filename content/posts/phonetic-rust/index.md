Rust, in particular, is a hard language to grok for beginners. For the typical, imperative programmer, Rust has too many weird, non-alphabetic symbols and a downright arcane looking syntax magic. Yet, for the functional programmer, Rust retains too much of the old cruft focus on object-oriented programming, with methods, traits (interfaces), and mutability. In order to help ease the transition, I thought I would maintain a list of helpful ways to pronounce various Rust-isms or Rust syntax. Often, when we are able to speak and read a language, we feel more confident writing in it as well.

- `fn` - "fun"
- `mut` - "mute"
- `println!` - "print lin"
- `'a: 'b` - "A outlives B"
