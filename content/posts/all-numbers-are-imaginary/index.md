I was thinking recently about the existence of negative numbers in the natural world, and how they are purely human constructions, cognitive models of the world enabled only once Arab mathematicians wrote down x + 1 = 0. They don’t exist in nature the same way positive numbers do. 

But, hold on, do positive numbers really exist either? The classic example here is to say “Of course they do! If I have an apple and you give me another, I have two apples.” But this - despite the utmost simplicity of the exchange - relies on at least several different human, cognitive constructs. First and foremost, in “nature’s” point of view, you don’t have two apples. You have an apple, and you have an apple. The grouping of these two objects - an apple and a so-called “other” apple - is a cognitive construct relying on: the equivalence of these two objects (identifying them both as apples. For example, a renowned apple expert might say instead you have one gala apple and one honeycrisp apple.); a “statefulness” of reality which remembers the fact that you already have an apple before considering another; and a concept of groups, sets, and order at all. What in practice is primally intuitive and axiomatic is in theory a set of cognitive models and heuristics which selectively ignore the stark reality: disorder.
