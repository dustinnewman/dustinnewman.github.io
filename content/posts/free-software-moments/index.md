This is a running page cataloging good examples of why free software is needed in the modern world.

- Reddit requiring login or usage of the mobile app (therefore login) to view comments.
- Pinterest gaming SEO to saturate queries and then locking those results behind a login wall.
- Twitter increasingly pressuring anonymous users to login to view tweets.
    - Update (May 2022): This is now a hard login wall after viewing a couple of tweets.
- Elon Musk saying he will "authenticate all humans."
- Treadmills advertising free workout courses while operating (safety hazard).
- Smart TVs running banner ads.
