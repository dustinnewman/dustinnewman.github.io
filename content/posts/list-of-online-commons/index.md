Drawing from the idea of the "Tragedy of the Commons," I have decided to compile a running (i.e. this page is mutable) list of what I consider good example of online "commons" - spaces which benefit everyone greatly and may even be in popular use, but which are difficult to run in a way which rewards the owner/maintainer. This will also contain some general examples I have as an American Xillenial (too young for Usenet, too old for Discord) of what constitutes homegrown Internet content that is harder to monetize than larger, ad-driven things.
