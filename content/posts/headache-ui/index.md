I am genetically prone to get headaches and migraines. Since I was around five or six, I have learned a variety of coping mechanisms, from taking pain relievers early to hot baths to green lights. [^1] Looking at a screen is never good for head pain, but in 2021, we can't always avoid it. Sometimes it's for work, sometimes it's for paying a bill or other bookkeeping, other times it's just for fun because who wants to lay in bed alone in the dark with a warm washcloth for hours? I have compiled a few life-saving tips over the years for using electronics when your body wants to do anything but, and thought I'd share them. 

## Night Shift
The first one is "night shift," or whatever the name is for increasing the warmness of the display. This is proven to be good for sleep, but I have also found it useful for headaches. Blue light in general is awful for the eyes and this is doubly true when you have a headache. Don't be afraid to max this one out.

## Reader View
Most of the web is terrible. I said it. Ads pop up, pages jump around as elements dynamically teleport in, inconsistent fonts, small text, everyone wants you to agree to their cookie policy or convert to their newsletter, it's just too much for the brain under distress. Reader View solves this problem for me. It presents one unified page, with no jumping, popping, or agreeing in sight. I wish every website was Reader View-ified, even when I don't have a headache. The problem with this is PDFs. I long for the day we can convert PDFs to HTML/text reliably but it seems unlikely since very few people besides me would really want this. The entire appeal of PDFs is being able to preserve the layout exactly as you intended, but whoever forgot night mode or responsivity clearly never had a migraine. PDFs are usually the apple of my eye: small, standardized, and portable. They really live up to their name in that way. But when I just took a couple Excedrin and am praying for the sun to take a day off, they are the devil incarnate, hand-crafted by Adobe to inflict maximum damage (at least they don't have pop-ups). 

## Dark Mode
One of the greatest inventions of the 21st century: dark mode. Even though I am not as evangelical as many others and still prefer light modes in daytime, going dark is a must if you have a headache. The best kinds of sites (including this one :)) auto-detect the system theme and adapt accordingly, but some others have separate buttons or switches too. As long as the option is there, it's appreciated. Just be careful not to squint. It's common when we're staring at screens to squint and unfortunately we carry that habit over to dark themes even though they reduce the need. Fight the urge to squint and save yourself some tension in those temples. Breatheee.

## Reduce Everything
You don't realize how much your phoneâ€¦ *moves* until you disable it. Transparent UIs, low contrast "aesthetic" designs, and animations so busy they seem choreographed all contribute to eye strain. I recommend reducing the white point, transparency, and motion if possible. The only thing to increase is the contrast, as that also reduces the work your delicate eyes need to do. I swear designers have never had headaches in their lives or they would never throw in so much glass, blur, frosting, and translucency effects. I'll admit: it definitely looks better with them enabled, but I honestly wonder how much, if any, toll it takes on our brains or vision centers over time. 

Next time you're lying in agony waiting for those painkillers to kick in and to get on with your life, I know the temptation to grab that phone is strong. And I'm not gonna tell you to resist! Sometimes you can't avoid it. But I hope these tips might help save you some pain along the way.

Oh, and look into green/multi-colored lights. They work amazingly well.
