I have found that my mood substantially improves when I go without a phone, headphones, or smart watch. I notice the color of the sky, the bird nests in the dead trees, the dandelions in lawns. I feel less anxious, more relaxed, and less agitated. My explanation for this is two fold. First, without a screen, I am able to visually and sensorially appreciate my surroundings, as previously described. Second, when you are walking with a screen in front of your face, you tend to only look up when things demand your attention. A cross walk, a loud noise, making room for other pedestrians. To attend to something. You are pulled from an alternate, virtual world where things appear from your whim into a physically intrusive one, which you have so far been ignoring. Given this framing, it is no wonder I find walking without a phone so much more pleasant, because I experience reality continuously, noticing all details as they appear, rather than discretely and only when I have to. What&rsquo;s more, despite the virtual world being at my whim, I find the physical one, when fully appreciated, far more pleasant and rewarding when I return home. This may because my animal brain and body are &ldquo;programmed&rdquo; for the natural world rather than the digital, or it may be for some other. Either way, I will try to incorporate this into my routine more frequently.</p></article></main><footer></footer></body></html>
