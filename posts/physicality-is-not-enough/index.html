Such a solution might be physical media in the place of digital. For some use cases, this works great. Printing out <a href=https://www.reuters.com/technology/exclusive-apples-child-protection-features-spark-concern-within-its-own-ranks-2021-08-12/>photographs</a> and buying <a href=https://www.nbcnews.com/technolog/you-dont-own-your-kindle-books-amazon-reminds-customer-1C6626211/>physical books</a> are both great examples of physicality being more censorship-resistant than their digital alternatives.</p><p>For audio and video, however, the situation is less clear-cut. With pictures and books, the medium is static and does not move through time. What you see is what you get, and there is no dynamic nature to it. With audio/video, however, you almost always need several layers of interpreters to transform the representation of sound and video into the real deal. Audio and video codecs must be implemented, usually by large companies who are very concerned with legal compliance.</p></article></main><footer></footer></body></html>
